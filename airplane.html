                <h2>Facts About Airplane</h2>
                <p>An airplane (North American English) or aeroplane (British English), informally plane, is a fixed-wing aircraft that is
                propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes,
                shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods
                and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually
                on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers[2] of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the
                world's cargo movement.[3] Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be
                remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.</p>

                <p>The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the first sustained and controlled
                heavier-than-air powered flight".[4] They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799, when he set forth the
                concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders)[5] and the
                work of German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal, who, between 1867 and 1896, also studied heavier-than-air
                flight. Lilienthal's flight attempts in 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight.[6] Following its limited use in
                World War I, aircraft technology continued to develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War
                II.</p>
